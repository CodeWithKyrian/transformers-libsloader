## TransformersPHP Libraries Downloader

This is a very simple composer plugin meant to work with the [`codewithkyrian/transformers`](https://github.com/codewithkyrian/transformers) package. It downloads the
shared libraries needed by the transformers package for the current platform and architecture when the package is installed, and verifies their
presence when the package is updated.
